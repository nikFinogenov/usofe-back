These instructions will help you set up a local development environment for Muffin.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A database (Postgres)
You can verify the installation and versions by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
psql --version
```

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikFinogenov/usofe-back

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd usofe-back
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file and fill in your environment variables.

   You need to set up these variables:

   > **These are necessary variables, server won't start without them**
   >
   > > - JWT_SECRET - secret for token
   > > - EMAIL_USER - email from which confirmations will be sent
   > > - EMAIL_PASS - password for EMAIL_USER (Not password for account, need [App password](https://knowledge.workspace.google.com/kb/how-to-create-app-passwords-000009237))

   ***

   > **These are variables for database init. Add them only if default values does not work for you.**
   >
   > > - PG_USER - role name of postgres (default value is `postgres`)
   > > - PG_PASS - password for PG_USER (default value is `null`)
   > > - PG_HOST - postgres host address (default value is `localhost`)
   > > - PG_PORT - database port (default value is `5432`)

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
